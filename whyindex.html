        <h5 class="card-title">What is 'Index Investing'</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Index investing is a passive strategy that attempts to generate similar returns as a broad market index. Investors use index investing to replicate the performance of a specific index – generally an equity or fixed-income index – by purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETF) that closely track the underlying index. There are numerous advantages of index investing. For one thing, empirical research finds index investing tends to outperform active management over a long time frame. Taking a hands off approach to investing eliminates many of the biases and uncertainties that arise in a stock picking strategy.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Now, Why It's a Great Strategy</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Index investing is the easiest approach to investing and actually one of the most profitable. Instead of the traditional route of investing where you pick individual stocks and hope they do well and make you money. The index approach of investing teaches to instead buy the whole market in one fund and let it do all the work for you. The market is known to have a wild ride, going up and down through the years, but no matter what happens it keeps climbing in value, slowly but surely. This approach of investing is widely accepted as a great way to begin investing because it is such a simple approach. You buy a fund and put as much money as you can into it!</p>
